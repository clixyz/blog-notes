# Blog Notes

This is a notes collection of my own 

(🚜 WIP, I'm migrating them from otherelse to here...).

### 🏡 Topics

Topics are various, but,
+ `android` and `aosp` (mostly), 
+ `browsers` and `web` (many), 
+ `programming languages` and `virtual machines` (some),
+ and other micellaneous ones (few).

### 🚦Attention

You'd bettern know before reading them,
+ Some of them are accomplished, but some of are not (taggeg with `todo`)
+ Some of them are my personal thoughts, but some of them are learned or borrowed directly from others (but I've put references)

### 🤝 Welcome

Last but not least, I'm learning as you are. So discussions are very much welcome. Let me know if you have any comments, questions, or even **corrections**. Please directly make comments under the issues that you are interested.
