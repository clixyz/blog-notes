# Blog Notes

This is a notes collection of my own.

🏡 Topics include 
+ `android` and `aosp` (mostly), 
+ `browsers` and `web` (many), 
+ `programming languages` and `virtual machines` (some),
+ and other micellaneous ones (few).

⁉️ Pay your attention before reading them:
+ Some of them are accomplished, but some of are not (taggeg with `todo`)
+ Some of them are my personal thoughts, but some of them are learned or borrowed directly from others (but I've put references)

😁 Last but not least, discussions and corrections are welcome, directly make comments under the issues that you are interested.
